# AnimatedClock

This is a sample project on animation and UI. It contains a animated clock with live time data.

The features used in this projects are: 
- Clock face with hour and minute hand uses current time.
- Animated waves surrounding the clock.
- Shadow effect to make the wave more realistic.

You can customize the amplitude(height), frequency(number of waves) and paint(color).

How it works:
- The 'drawClockHands' method calculates and draws the hour and minute  based on the current time. 
- The 'drawWaves' method creates a wave effect by drawing paths in a circular pattern.
- The 'startWaveAnimation' method animates the wave effects.
